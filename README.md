# sakkuapp
  After I have finished learning about backend Golang and chatbot development in February 2022 I initiative to improve my skill by making these chatbot projects. 
And I use JWT Auth Service for user login and logout and hash password in MySQL database using BcryptJS

### Step by step using this chatbot
- First you have to search for this bot in telegram with the name "sakkubot"
- Second you need to click start and register your account if you don't have an account
- Then you can login with your account and start your transaction
